Encoder is a simple demonstration of using DPAPI to encode or decode text.

More precisely, the text is encoded as a UTF-8 byte stream, then encoded using the Windows DPAPI to a blob, then displayed in hexadecimal.  Decoding is the reverse of this process.

Encoder runs using .NET 4.0, and displays a simple form using WPF.

Encoder is licensed using the MIT license.
